The main file is "sadc.m". Here's an example of how to run it:

[clust_id,gt_id] = sadc(91,20,15);

Please refer to the code for more details regarding the parameters.

I have created folders "ground_truth_grDetect" and "CUHKcrowd_dataset_imgTrk" only for testing purposes.
It contains info. of only 1 scene (scene no. 91).

Please download the original CUHK dataset from the below link to get all the data within these folders.
